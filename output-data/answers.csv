"Question A:                                The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry‚Äôs domestic assets (an average of 10% each).  In early 1998, before Glass-Steagall ended and before Citicorp merged with Travelers, they held 13.2% (an average of 3.3% each). Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).Capping US banks‚Äô size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.","Tuesday, May 3rd, 2016 2:22 pm",Richard Schmalensee,Uncertain,4
